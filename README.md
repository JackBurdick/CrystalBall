# CrystalBall

CrystalBall is (will be...) an open source library for automated machine learning. Leveraging [YeahML](https://github.com/JackBurdick/YeahML), CrystalBall will perform and log an architecture and hyperparameter search of deep learning models to perform a user specified task.

## Development
This repository is a placeholder (see what I did there?) for future work. Currently, [YeahML](https://github.com/JackBurdick/YeahML) is the development focus, as it will provide the foundation for CrystalBall to be built on. If you are interested in helping with development please reach out to me on twitter [@Jack_Burdick](https://twitter.com/Jack_Burdick) or create and issue in the repository.
